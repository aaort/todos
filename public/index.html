          <p class="description-text">
            The motivation for building this project was simply learning and
            exploring new Technologies for myself. Also I wanted some simple and
            unfancy way for managing my tasks during the day.

          <h2 class="description-title">How it's done</h2>
          <p class="description-text">
            This project is built using
            <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a> for client and
            <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> for back-end.
            This was my first and learning project with Flutter and I can't be
            thankful enough for this awesome journey.
